# React JS Quiz

1. What is React?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook for building complex, interactive UIs in web and mobile applications.

The key point in this answer is that React‚Äôs core purpose is to build UI components;it is often referred to as just the ‚ÄúV‚Äù (View) in an ‚ÄúMVC‚Äù architecture. Therefore it has no opinions on the other pieces of your technology stack and can be seamlessly integrated into any application.
</p>

2. How is React different from other Javascript frameworks?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
React is a small library focused on building UI components.

By comparison, AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime. As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application.

By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application‚Äôs architecture. This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem ‚Äúbest‚Äù ‚Äî though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.
</p>
</details>

_Note:_ There are likely _many_ answers to this question. Most will depend on experiences with other frameworks.

3. What can you tell me about JSX?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
JSX, aka 'JavaScript eXtension' is XML like syntax developed for use in React. It allows developers to write Javascript that _looks_ like HTML. JSX code by itself cannot be read by the browser; it must be transpiled into traditional JavaScript using tools like Babel and webpack. 
</p>

#### Key Talking Points

* Developers do not have to use JSX (and ES2015) to write an application in React.
* Having said that, many React developers prefer to use JSX as its syntax is far more declarative and reduces overall code complexity. Facebook certainly encourages it in all of their documentation!
* Adopting JSX allows the developer to simultaneously adopt ES2015 ‚Äî giving immediate access to some wonderful syntactic sugar.

4. What is the difference between a state and a prop?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
>In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.
>
> The state can be initialized by props.

5. What is a stateless/functional component? Give an example.

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A stateless, aka functional, component is _just_ a Javascript function that can receive props and return a React element.
</p>

```
const myGreetingComponent = props => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello {props.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```
</details>

6. What are some of the benefits of using a stateless function over a regular?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

> [A] functional component has no state, no lifecycle methods and it‚Äôs easy to write(plain function) [...] a class component has state, lifecycle methods and React creates an instance of a class component every time React renders it. If you don‚Äôt need to use state or lifecycle I would recommend you to use a function component, but If there‚Äôs a chance that you need one of those things(state, lifecycle methods) I would suggest you to use class component.

7. What is the purpose of the render function?

<details>
<summary<b>Answer</b></summary>
<p> 
The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. 

In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render.
</p>

8. What is the purpose of "key" in React?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Keys are what help React keep track of what items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list.
</p>
</details>

9. What happens when you call setState?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. 

This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state. 

To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff (`diff`: check the differences of) this new tree against the previous element tree. 

By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.

10. What is meant by "Data is passed down"?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

React has _one-way_  data binding.  Specifically, React's UI is changed based on changes to the data model. The changes move from the model, it is the single source of truth. 

By comparison, two-way data binding means that the model changes with the UI, and vice-versa. 

One-way data binding means that data is always moving in one direction. This flow is more predictable, with has fewer side effects.

Common React data flow patterns are:

* Parent -> Child
* Child -> Parent (using callbacks)
* Between siblings (messy, but possible).

11. What does create-react-app do?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Per the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) 

> Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

Using `create-react-app` will quickly scaffold out a React application with all the basic libraries, folder structure, and scripts that you need to get a React application up and running quickly.

## BONUS

1. What is the purpose of "refs" in React?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Refs allow direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. 

In order to use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument.
</p>
</details>

2. What‚Äôs the difference between an Element and a Component in React?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A React _element_ describes what you want to see on the screen. It is an object representation of some UI.

A React _component_ is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets transpiled to a createElement invocation).
</p>

3. What happens during the lifecycle of a React component?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
High-Level Component Lifecycle

At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that fall into three general categories:

* Initialization
* State/Property Updates
* Destruction

Every React component defines these events as a mechanism for managing its properties, state, and rendered output. Some of these events only happen once, others happen more frequently; understanding these three general categories should help you clearly visualize when certain logic needs to be applied.

For example, a component may need to add event listeners to the DOM when it first mounts. However, it should probably remove those event listeners when the component unmounts from the DOM so that irrelevant processing does not occur.
</p>

`componentDidMount()`

`componentWillUnmount()`

5. Is anything wrong with this code?

```
this.setState((prevState, props) => { 
    return { 
        streak: prevState.streak + props.count  
    }
})
```

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Nothing is wrong with it üôÇ. 

It‚Äôs rarely used and not well known, but you can also pass a function to `setState` that receives the previous state and props and returns a new state, just as we‚Äôre doing above. 

This is actually recommended if you‚Äôre setting state based on previous state.
